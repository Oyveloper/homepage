      <description>In machine learning we often use regularization in order to combat over- and underfitting. Typically one would use either uidge regularization or lasso regularization, and I assume that you are familiar with these. The explanation for why the regularization helps our models generalize better is typically along the lines of &amp;ldquo;it simplifies the model&amp;rdquo;, which for me at least is a bit of an unsatisfying answer. Luckily there is one other way you could view it which shows why this works in many cases for ridge regularization.</description>
